In this challenge, I coved the entirety of the NLTK  and the Hands-on Machine Learning textbooks

NTLK is the fundamental NLP/NLU textbook. It reinforces Python coding concepts, introduces preprocessing for text, statistical models for building POS, IOB, and Entity tagging.  Context-free grammars for extracting sentences from corpora and more. 

HOML is a pragmatic book for machine-learning in Python with Sci-kit Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.
