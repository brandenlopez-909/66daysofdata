In general, Elastic Net is preferred over Lasso because Lasso may behave erratically when the number of features is greater than the number of training instances or when several features are strongly correlated.\n",

To solve this you should scale the data before training the model. Note that the Normal Equation or SVD approach will work just fine without scaling. Moreover, regularized models may converge to a suboptimal solution if the features are not scaled: since regularization penalizes large weights, features with smaller values will tend to be ignored compared to features with larger values."

This will also reduce the degrees of freedom of the model. Lastly, you can try to increase the size of the training set."
