    "What does it offer: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Its core is very similar to NumPy, but with GPU support.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It supports distributed computing (across multiple devices and servers).\n",
    "\n",
    "- It includes a kind of just-in-time (JIT) compiler that allows it to optimize computations for speed and memory usage. It works by extracting the computation graph from a Python function, then optimizing it (e.g., by pruning unused nodes), and finally running it efficiently (e.g., by automatically running independent operations in parallel).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computation graphs can be exported to a portable format, so you can train a TensorFlow model in one environment (e.g., using Python on Linux) and run it in another (e.g., using Java on an Android device).\n",
    "\n",
    "- It implements autodiff (see Chapter 10 and Appendix D) and provides some excellent optimizers, such as RMSProp and Nadam (see Chapter 11), so you can easily minimize all sorts of loss functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  it also has data loading and preprocessing ops\n",
    "\n",
    "![API Overview](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492032632/files/assets/mls2_1201.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the lowest level, each TensorFlow operation (op for short) is implemented using highly efficient C++ code.\n",
    "\n",
    "95% of the time, keras is enough. That 5% is what this chapter is for. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you do not want to use the Python API, there are C++, Java, Go, and Swift APIs.There is even a JavaScript implementation called TensorFlow.js that makes it possible to run your models directly in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Google’s TensorFlow Hub provides a way to easily download and reuse pretrained neural networks.  There is also the [TF Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The book contains many other links to awesome TF resources, check it out! \n",

    "A tensor is very similar to a NumPy ndarray: it is usually a multidimensional array, but it can also hold a scalar (a simple value, such as 42). These tensors will be important when we create custom cost functions, custom metrics, custom layers, and more, so let’s see how to create and manipulate them."

    " - The constructor takes all the hyperparameters as arguments (in this example, units and activation), and importantly it also takes a **kwargs argument. It calls the parent constructor, passing it the kwargs: this takes care of standard arguments such as input_shape, trainable, and name. Then it saves the hyperparameters as attributes, converting the activation argument to the appropriate activation function using the keras.activations.get() function (it accepts functions, standard strings like \"relu\" or \"selu\", or simply None).\n",
    "\n",
    " - The build() method’s role is to create the layer’s variables by calling the add_weight() method for each weight. The build() method is called the first time the layer is used. At that point, Keras will know the shape of this layer’s inputs, and it will pass it to the build() method,9 which is often necessary to create some of the weights. For example, we need to know the number of neurons in the previous layer in order to create the connection weights matrix (i.e., the \"kernel\"): this corresponds to the size of the last dimension of the inputs. At the end of the build() method (and only at the end), you must call the parent’s build() method: this tells Keras that the layer is built (it just sets self.built=True).\n",
    "\n",
    " - The call() method performs the desired operations. In this case, we compute the matrix multiplication of the inputs X and the layer’s kernel, we add the bias vector, and we apply the activation function to the result, and this gives us the output of the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The compute_output_shape() method simply returns the shape of this layer’s outputs. In this case, it is the same shape as the inputs, except the last dimension is replaced with the number of neurons in the layer. Note that in tf.keras, shapes are instances of the tf.TensorShape class, which you can convert to Python lists using as_list().\n",

    "\n",
    "Most of the time, converting a Python function that performs TensorFlow operations into a TF Function is trivial: decorate it with @tf.function or let Keras take care of it for you. However, there are a few rules to respect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you call any external library, including NumPy or even the standard library, this call will run only during tracing; it will not be part of the graph. Indeed, a TensorFlow graph can only include TensorFlow constructs (tensors, operations, variables, datasets, and so on). So, make sure you use tf.reduce_sum() instead of np.sum(), tf.sort() instead of the built-in sorted() function, and so on (unless you really want the code to run only during tracing). This has a few additional implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you define a TF Function f(x) that just returns np.random.rand(), a random number will only be generated when the function is traced, so f(tf.constant(2.)) and f(tf.constant(3.)) will return the same random number, but f(tf.constant([2., 3.])) will return a different one. If you replace np.random.rand() with tf.random.uniform([]), then a new random number will be generated upon every call, since the operation will be part of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your non-TensorFlow code has side effects (such as logging something or updating a Python counter), then you should not expect those side effects to occur every time you call the TF Function, as they will only occur when the function is traced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can wrap arbitrary Python code in a tf.py_function() operation, but doing so will hinder performance, as TensorFlow will not be able to do any graph optimization on this code. It will also reduce portability, as the graph will only run on platforms where Python is available (and where the right libraries are installed).\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can call other Python functions or TF Functions, but they should follow the same rules, as TensorFlow will capture their operations in the computation graph. Note that these other functions do not need to be decorated with @tf.function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the function creates a TensorFlow variable (or any other stateful TensorFlow object, such as a dataset or a queue), it must do so upon the very first call, and only then, or else you will get an exception. It is usually preferable to create variables outside of the TF Function (e.g., in the build() method of a custom layer). If you want to assign a new value to the variable, make sure you call its assign() method, instead of using the = operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The source code of your Python function should be available to TensorFlow. If the source code is unavailable (for example, if you define your function in the Python shell, which does not give access to the source code, or if you deploy only the compiled *.pyc Python files to production), then the graph generation process will fail or have limited functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- TensorFlow will only capture for loops that iterate over a tensor or a dataset. So make sure you use for i in tf.range(x) rather than for i in range(x), or else the loop will not be captured in the graph. Instead, it will run during tracing. (This may be what you want if the for loop is meant to build the graph, for example to create each layer in a neural network.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- As always, for performance reasons, you should prefer a vectorized implementation whenever you can, rather than using loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s time to sum up! In this chapter we started with a brief overview of TensorFlow, then we looked at TensorFlow’s low-level API, including tensors, operations, variables, and special data structures. We then used these tools to customize almost every component in tf.keras. Finally, we looked at how TF Functions can boost performance, how graphs are generated using AutoGraph and tracing, and what rules to follow when you write TF Functions (if you would like to open the black box a bit further, for example to explore the generated graphs, you will find technical details in Appendix G).\n",
