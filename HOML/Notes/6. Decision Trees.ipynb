A few other hyperparameters (described in a moment) control additional stopping conditions (min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, min_weight_fraction_leaf, and max_leaf_nodes).\n",

    "Making predictions requires traversing the Decision Tree from the root to a leaf. Decision Trees generally are approximately balanced, so traversing the Decision Tree requires going through roughly $(log_2(m))$ nodes. Since each node only requires checking the value of one feature, the overall prediction complexity is $O(log_2(m))$, independent of the number of features. So predictions are very fast, even when dealing with large training sets.\n",

    "The training algorithm compares all features (or less if max_features is set) on all samples at each node. Comparing all features on all samples at each node results in a training complexity of O(n × m log2(m)). For small training sets (less than a few thousand instances), Scikit-Learn can speed up training by presorting the data (set presort=True), but doing that slows down training considerably for larger training sets.\n",

    "# Gini Impurity or Entropy?\n",

The concept of entropy originated in thermodynamics as a measure of molecular disorder: entropy approaches zero when molecules are still and well ordered. Entropy later spread to a wide variety of domains, including Shannon’s information theory, where it measures the average information content of a message: entropy is zero when all messages are identical. In Machine Learning, entropy is frequently used as an impurity measure: a set’s entropy is zero when it contains instances of only one class. Equation 6-3 shows the definition of the entropy of the ith node. For example, the depth-2 left node in Figure 6-1 has an entropy equal to $–(49/54) log_2 (49/54) – (5/54) log_2 (5/54) ≈ 0.445$.\n",

    "So, should you use Gini impurity or entropy? The truth is, most of the time it does not make a big difference: they lead to similar trees. Gini impurity is slightly faster to compute, so it is a good default. However, when they differ, Gini impurity tends to isolate the most frequent class in its own branch of the tree, while entropy tends to produce slightly more balanced trees\n",

    "# Regularization Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees make very few assumptions about the training data (as opposed to linear models, which assume that the data is linear, for example). If left unconstrained, the tree structure will adapt itself to the training data, fitting it very closely—indeed, most likely overfitting it. Such a model is often called a nonparametric model, not because it does not have any parameters (it often has a lot) but because the number of parameters is not determined prior to training, so the model structure is free to stick closely to the data. In contrast, a parametric model, such as a linear model, has a predetermined number of parameters, so its degree of freedom is limited, reducing the risk of overfitting (but increasing the risk of underfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid overfitting the training data, you need to restrict the Decision Tree’s freedom during training. As you know by now, this is called regularization. The regularization hyperparameters depend on the algorithm used, but generally you can at least restrict the maximum depth of the Decision Tree. In Scikit-Learn, this is controlled by the max_depth hyperparameter (the default value is None, which means unlimited). Reducing max_depth will regularize the model and thus reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DecisionTreeClassifier class has a few other parameters that similarly restrict the shape of the Decision Tree: min_samples_split (the minimum number of samples a node must have before it can be split), min_samples_leaf (the minimum number of samples a leaf node must have), min_weight_fraction_leaf (same as min_samples_leaf but expressed as a fraction of the total number of weighted instances), max_leaf_nodes (the maximum number of leaf nodes), and max_features (the maximum number of features that are evaluated for splitting at each node). Increasing min_* hyperparameters or reducing max_* hyperparameters will regularize the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NOTE** : Other algorithms work by first training the Decision Tree without restrictions, then pruning (deleting) unnecessary nodes. A node whose children are all leaf nodes is considered unnecessary if the purity improvement it provides is not statistically significant. Standard statistical tests, such as the $\\chi^2$ test (chi-squared test), are used to estimate the probability that the improvement is purely the result of chance (which is called the null hypothesis). If this probability, called the p-value, is higher than a given threshold (typically 5%, controlled by a hyperparameter), then the node is considered unnecessary and its children are deleted. The pruning continues until all unnecessary nodes have been pruned.\n",

On the left the Decision Tree is trained with the default hyperparameters (i.e., no restrictions), and on the right it’s trained with min_samples_leaf=4.

    "Hopefully by now you are convinced that Decision Trees have a lot going for them: they are simple to understand and interpret, easy to use, versatile, and powerful. However, they do have a few limitations. First, as you may have noticed, Decision Trees love orthogonal decision boundaries (all splits are perpendicular to an axis), which makes them sensitive to training set rotation. For example, Figure 6-7 shows a simple linearly separable dataset: on the left, a Decision Tree can split it easily, while on the right, after the dataset is rotated by 45°, the decision boundary looks unnecessarily convoluted. Although both Decision Trees fit the training set perfectly, it is very likely that the model on the right will not generalize well. One way to limit this problem is to use Principal Component Analysis (see Chapter 8), which often results in a better orientation of the training data.\n",

As you can see, it looks very different from the previous Decision Tree (Figure 6-2).
