    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if you aggregate the predictions of a group of predictors (such as classifiers or regressors), you will often get better predictions than with the best individual predictor. A group of predictors is called an ensemble; thus, this technique is called Ensemble Learning, and an Ensemble Learning algorithm is called an Ensemble method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of an Ensemble method, you can train a group of Decision Tree classifiers, each on a different random subset of the training set. To make predictions, you obtain the predictions of all the individual trees, then predict the class that gets the most votes. Such an ensemble of Decision Trees is called a Random Forest, and despite its simplicity, this is one of the most powerful Machine Learning algorithms available today.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will often use Ensemble methods near the end of a project, once you have already built a few good predictors, to combine them into an even better predictor. In fact, the winning solutions in Machine Learning competitions often involve several Ensemble methods (most famously in the Netflix Prize competition).\n",

    "A very simple way to create an even better classifier is to aggregate the predictions of each classifier and predict the class that gets the most votes. This majority-vote classifier is called a hard voting classifier(below). \n",

    "Somewhat surprisingly, this voting classifier often achieves a higher accuracy than the best classifier in the ensemble. In fact, even if each classifier is a weak learner (meaning it does only slightly better than random guessing), the ensemble can still be a strong learner (achieving high accuracy), provided there are a sufficient number of weak learners and they are sufficiently diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is this possible? The following analogy can help shed some light on this mystery. Suppose you have a slightly biased coin that has a 51% chance of coming up heads and 49% chance of coming up tails. If you toss it 1,000 times, you will generally get more or less 510 heads and 490 tails, and hence a majority of heads. If you do the math, you will find that the probability of obtaining a majority of heads after 1,000 tosses is close to 75%. The more you toss the coin, the higher the probability (e.g., with 10,000 tosses, the probability climbs over 97%). This is due to the law of large numbers: as you keep tossing the coin, the ratio of heads gets closer and closer to the probability of heads (51%). Figure 7-3 shows 10 series of biased coin tosses. You can see that as the number of tosses increases, the ratio of heads approaches 51%. Eventually all 10 series end up so close to 51% that they are consistently above 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, suppose you build an ensemble containing 1,000 classifiers that are individually correct only 51% of the time (barely better than random guessing). If you predict the majority voted class, you can hope for up to 75% accuracy! However, this is only true if all classifiers are perfectly independent, making uncorrelated errors, which is clearly not the case because they are trained on the same data. They are likely to make the same types of errors, so there will be many majority votes for the wrong class, reducing the ensemble’s accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TIP**:Ensemble methods work best when the predictors are as independent from one another as possible. One way to get diverse classifiers is to train them using very different algorithms. This increases the chance that they will make very different types of errors, improving the ensemble’s accuracy.\n",

    "For example, when training an AdaBoost classifier, the algorithm first trains a base classifier (such as a Decision Tree) and uses it to make predictions on the training set. The algorithm then increases the relative weight of misclassified training instances. Then it trains a second classifier, using the updated weights, and again makes predictions on the training set, updates the instance weights, and so on (see figure below for illustration)\n",

The plot on the right represents the same sequence of predictors, except that the learning rate is halved (i.e., the misclassified instance weights are boosted much less at every iteration). As you can see, this sequential learning technique has some similarities with Gradient Descent, except that instead of tweaking a single predictor’s parameters to minimize a cost function, AdaBoost adds predictors to the ensemble, gradually making it better.\n",

If you set it to a low value, such as 0.1, you will need more trees in the ensemble to fit the training set, but the predictions will usually generalize better. This is a regularization technique called shrinkage. Figure 7-10 shows two GBRT ensembles trained with a low learning rate: the one on the left does not have enough trees to fit the training set, while the one on the right has too many trees and overfits the training set.\n",

The following code trains a GBRT ensemble with 120 trees, then measures the validation error at each stage of training to find the optimal number of trees, and finally trains another GBRT ensemble using the optimal number of trees:"

    "The last Ensemble method we will discuss in this chapter is called stacking (short for stacked generalization). It is based on a simple idea: instead of using trivial functions (such as hard voting) to aggregate the predictions of all predictors in an ensemble, why don’t we train a model to perform this aggregation? The figure below shows such an ensemble performing a regression task on a new instance. Each of the bottom three predictors predicts a different value (3.1, 2.7, and 2.9), and then the final predictor (called a blender, or a meta learner) takes these predictions as inputs and makes the final prediction (3.0).\n",

    "\n",
    "To train the blender, a common approach is to use a hold-out set. Let’s see how it works. First, the training set is split into two subsets. The first subset is used to train the predictors in the first layer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, the first layer’s predictors are used to make predictions on the second (held-out) set (see figure above). This ensures that the predictions are “clean,” since the predictors never saw these instances during training. For each instance in the hold-out set, there are three predicted values. We can create a new training set using these predicted values as input features (which makes this new training set 3D), and keeping the target values. The blender is trained on this new training set, so it learns to predict the target value, given the first layer’s predictions.\n",

    "It is actually possible to train several different blenders this way (e.g., one using Linear Regression, another using Random Forest Regression), to get a whole layer of blenders. The trick is to split the training set into three subsets: the first one is used to train the first layer, the second one is used to create the training set used to train the second layer (using predictions made by the predictors of the first layer), and the third one is used to create the training set to train the third layer (using predictions made by the predictors of the second layer). Once this is done, we can make a prediction for a new instance by going through each layer sequentially, as shown below\n",
