One possible approach to parsing productions containing feature constraints is to compile out all admissible values of the features in question so that we end up with a large, fully specified CFG along the lines of grammer (6). By contrast, the parser process illustrated above works directly with the underspecified productions given by the grammar. Feature values \"flow upwards\" from lexical entries, and variable values are then associated with those values, via bindings (i.e., dictionaries) such as {?n:\n",
    "'sg', ?t: 'pres'}. As the parser assembles information about the nodes of the tree it is building, these variable bindings are used to instantiate values in these nodes; thus the underspecified VP[NUM=?n, TENSE=?t] -> TV[NUM=?n, TENSE=?t] NP[] becomes instantiated as VP[NUM='sg', TENSE='pres'] -> TV[NUM='sg',\n",

A special case of atomic values are boolean values, that is, values that just specify whether a property is true or false. For example, we might want to distinguish auxiliary verbs such as can, may, will and do with the boolean feature AUX. For example, the production V[TENSE=pres, AUX=+] -> 'can' means that can receives the value pres for TENSE and + or true for AUX. There is a widely adopted convention which abbreviates the representation of boolean features f; instead of AUX=+ or AUX=-, we use +AUX and -AUX respectively. These are just abbreviations, however, and the parser interprets them as though + and - are like any other atomic value. (15) shows some representative productions:\n",
    "\n",
    "(15)\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "    V[TENSE=pres, +AUX] -> 'can'\n",
    "    V[TENSE=pres, +AUX] -> 'may'\n",
    "\n",
    "    V[TENSE=pres, -AUX] -> 'walks'\n",
    "    V[TENSE=pres, -AUX] -> 'likes\n",
    "    \n",
    "We have spoken of attaching \"feature annotations\" to syntactic categories. A more radical approach represents the whole category — that is, the non-terminal symbol plus the annotation — as a bundle of features. For example, N[NUM=sg] contains part of speech information which can be represented as POS=N. An alternative notation for this category therefore is [POS=N, NUM=sg].\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to atomic-valued features, features may take values that are themselves feature structures. For example, we can group together agreement features (e.g., person, number and gender) as a distinguished part of a category, grouped together as the value of AGR. In this case, we say that AGR has a complex value. (16) depicts the structure, in a format known as an attribute value matrix (AVM).\n",

On this approach, SUBCAT can only appear on lexical categories; it makes no sense, for example, to specify a SUBCAT value on VP. As required, walk and like both belong to the category V.

    "An alternative treatment of subcategorization, due originally to a framework known as categorial grammar, is represented in feature based frameworks such as PATR and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar. Rather than using SUBCAT values as a way of indexing productions, the SUBCAT value directly encodes the valency of a head (the list of arguments that it can combine with). For example, a verb like put that takes NP and PP complements (put the book on the table) might be represented as (31):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(31)\t\n",
    "\n",
    "    V[SUBCAT=<NP, NP, PP>]\n",
    "    \n",
    "This says that the verb can combine with three arguments. The leftmost element in the list is the subject NP, while everything else — an NP followed by a PP in this case — comprises the subcategorized-for complements. When a verb like put is combined with appropriate complements, the requirements which are specified in the SUBCAT are discharged, and only a subject NP is needed. This category, which corresponds to what is traditionally thought of as VP, might be represented as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "(32)\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "    V[SUBCAT=<NP>]\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a sentence is a kind of verbal category that has no requirements for further arguments, and hence has a SUBCAT whose value is the empty list. The tree (33) shows how these category assignments combine in a parse of Kim put the book on the table.\n",

    "# 3.2   Heads Revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "We noted in the previous section that by factoring subcategorization information out of the main category label, we could express more generalizations about properties of verbs. Another property of this kind is the following: expressions of category V are heads of phrases of category VP. Similarly, Ns are heads of NPs, As (i.e., adjectives) are heads of APs, and Ps (i.e., prepositions) are heads of PPs. Not all phrases have heads — for example, it is standard to say that coordinate phrases (e.g., the book and the bell) lack heads — nevertheless, we would like our grammar formalism to express the parent / head-child relation where it holds. At present, V and VP are just atomic symbols, and we need to find a way to relate them using features (as we did earlier to relate IV and TV).\n",
    "\n",
    "X-bar Syntax addresses this issue by abstracting out the notion of phrasal level. It is usual to recognize three such levels. If N represents the lexical level, then N' represents the next level up, corresponding to the more traditional category Nom, while N'' represents the phrasal level, corresponding to the category NP. (34a) illustrates a representative structure while (34b) is the more conventional counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "The head of the structure (34a) is N while N' and N'' are called (phrasal) projections of N. N'' is the maximal projection, and N is sometimes called the zero projection. One of the central claims of X-bar syntax is that all constituents share a structural similarity. Using X as a variable over N, V, A and P, we say that directly subcategorized complements of a lexical head X are always placed as siblings of the head, whereas adjuncts are placed as siblings of the intermediate category, X'. Thus, the configuration of the two P'' adjuncts in (35) contrasts with that of the complement P'' in (34a).\n",

One issue of considerable importance in theoretical linguistics has been the nature of the material that can intervene between a filler and the gap that it licenses; in particular, can we simply list a finite set of sequences that separate the two? The answer is No: there is no upper bound on the distance between filler and gap. This fact can be easily illustrated with constructions involving sentential complements, as shown in (50).\n",

    "\n",
    "A variety of mechanisms have been suggested for handling unbounded dependencies in formal grammars; here we illustrate the approach due to Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar that involves slash categories. A slash category has the form Y/XP; we interpret this as a phrase of category Y that is missing a sub-constituent of category XP. For example, S/NP is an S that is missing an NP. The use of slash categories is illustrated in (51).\n",
