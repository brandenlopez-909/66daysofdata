Given a particular company, we would like to be able to identify the locations where it does business; conversely, given a location, we would like to discover which companies do business in that location. If our data is in tabular form, such as the example in 1.1, then answering these queries is straightforward.\n",

Next, each sentence is tagged with part-of-speech tags, which will prove very helpful in the next step, named entity detection. In this step, we search for mentions of potentially interesting entities in each sentence. Finally, we use relation detection to search for likely relations between different entities in the text.\n",

    "Next, in named entity detection, we segment and label the entities that might participate in interesting relations with one another. Typically, these will be definite noun phrases such as the knights who say \"ni\", or proper names such as Monty Python. In some tasks it is useful to also consider indefinite nouns or noun chunks, such as every student or cats, and these do not necessarily refer to entities in the same way as definite NPs and proper names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in relation extraction, we search for specific patterns between pairs of entities that occur near one another in the text, and use those patterns to build tuples recording the relationships between the entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2   Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic technique we will use for entity detection is _chunking_ , which segments and labels multi-token sequences as illustrated in 2.1. The smaller boxes show the word-level tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, while the large boxes show higher-level chunking. Each of these larger boxes is called a chunk. Like tokenization, which omits whitespace, chunking usually selects a subset of the tokens. Also like tokenization, the pieces produced by a chunker do not overlap in the source text.\n",

We will see regular expression and n-gram approaches to chunking, and will develop and evaluate chunkers using the CoNLL-2000 chunking corpus. We will then return in sections 5 and 6 to the tasks of named entity recognition and relation extraction.\n",

    "# 2.1   Noun Phrase Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by considering the task of noun phrase chunking, or NP-chunking, where we search for chunks corresponding to individual noun phrases. For example, here is some Wall Street Journal text with NP-chunks marked using brackets:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (2)\t\t[ The/DT market/NN ] for/IN [ system-management/NN software/NN ] for/IN [ Digital/NNP ] [ 's/POS hardware/NN ] is/VBZ fragmented/JJ enough/RB that/IN [ a/DT giant/NN ] such/JJ as/IN [ Computer/NNP Associates/NNPS ] should/MD do/VB well/RB there/RB ./.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "As we can see, NP-chunks are often smaller pieces than complete noun phrases. For example, _the market for system-management software for Digital's hardware_ is a single noun phrase (containing two nested noun phrases), but it is captured in NP-chunks by the simpler chunk the market. One of the motivations for this difference is that NP-chunks are defined so as not to contain other NP-chunks. Consequently, any prepositional phrases or subordinate clauses that modify a nominal will not be included in the corresponding NP-chunk, since they almost certainly contain further noun phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful sources of information for NP-chunking is part-of-speech tags. This is one of the motivations for performing part-of-speech tagging in our information extraction system. We demonstrate this approach using an example sentence that has been part-of-speech tagged in section 2.2. In order to create an NP-chunker, we will first define a chunk grammar, consisting of rules that indicate how sentences should be chunked. In this case, we will define a simple grammar with a single regular-expression rule. This rule says that an NP chunk should be formed whenever the chunker finds an optional determiner (DT) followed by any number of adjectives (JJ) and then a noun (NN). Using this grammar, we create a chunk parser, and test it on our example sentence. The result is a tree, which we can either print, or display graphically.\n",

In this scheme, each token is tagged with one of three special chunk tags, _I (inside)_ , _O (outside)_ , or _B (begin)_ . A token is tagged as B if it marks the beginning of a chunk. Subsequent tokens within the chunk are tagged I . All other tokens are tagged O. The B and I tags are suffixed with the chunk type, e.g. B-NP, I-NP. Of course, it is not necessary to specify a chunk type for tokens that appear outside a chunk, so these are just labeled O. An example of this scheme is shown in 2.5 below.\n",

We will see how to score the accuracy of a chunker relative to a corpus, then look at some more data-driven ways to search for NP chunks. Our focus throughout will be on expanding the coverage of a chunker.\n",

    "# 3.3   Training Classifier-Based Chunkers\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the regular-expression based chunkers and the n-gram chunkers decide what chunks to create entirely based on part-of-speech tags. However, sometimes part-of-speech tags are insufficient to determine how a sentence should be chunked. For example, consider the following two statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a.\t\tJoey/NN sold/VBD the/DT farmer/NN rice/NN ./.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b.\t\tNick/NN broke/VBD my/DT computer/NN monitor/NN ./.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two sentences have the same part-of-speech tags, yet they are chunked differently. In the first sentence, the farmer and rice are separate chunks, while the corresponding material in the second sentence, the computer monitor, is a single chunk. Clearly, we need to make use of information about the content of the words, in addition to just their part-of-speech tags, if we wish to maximize chunking performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way that we can incorporate information about the content of words is to use a classifier-based tagger to chunk the sentence. Like the n-gram chunker considered in the previous section, this classifier-based chunker will work by assigning IOB tags to the words in a sentence, and then converting those tags to chunks. For the classifier-based tagger itself, we will use the same approach that we used in 1 to build a part-of-speech tagger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic code for the classifier-based NP chunker is shown in 3.2 below. It consists of two classes. The first class is almost identical to the ConsecutivePosTagger class from 1.5. The only two differences are that it calls a different feature extractor and that it uses a MaxentClassifier rather than a NaiveBayesClassifier. The second class is basically a wrapper around the tagger class that turns it into a chunker. During training, this second class maps the chunk trees in the training corpus into tag sequences; in the parse() method, it converts the tag sequence provided by the tagger back into a chunk tree."

    "# 5   Named Entity Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of this chapter, we briefly introduced named entities (NEs). Named entities are definite noun phrases that refer to specific types of individuals, such as organizations, persons, dates, and so on. These should be self-explanatory, except for \"Facility\": human-made artifacts in the domains of architecture and civil engineering; and \"GPE\": geo-political entities such as city, state/province, and country.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a named entity recognition (NER) system is to identify all textual mentions of the named entities. This can be broken down into two sub-tasks: identifying the boundaries of the NE, and identifying its type. While named entity recognition is frequently a prelude to identifying relations in Information Extraction, it can also contribute to other tasks. For example, in Question Answering (QA), we try to improve the precision of Information Retrieval by recovering not whole pages, but just those parts which contain an answer to the user's question. Most QA systems take the documents returned by standard Information Retrieval, and then attempt to isolate the minimal text snippet in the document containing the answer. Now suppose the question was Who was the first President of the US?, and one of the documents that was retrieved contained the following passage:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Washington Monument is the most prominent structure in Washington, D.C. and one of the city's early attractions. It was built in honor of George Washington, who led the country to independence and then became its first President.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Analysis of the question leads us to expect that an answer should be of the form X was the first President of the US, where X is not only a noun phrase, but also refers to a named entity of type PERSON. This should allow us to ignore the first sentence in the passage. While it contains two occurrences of Washington, named entity recognition should tell us that neither of them has the correct type.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we go about identifying named entities? One option would be to look up each word in an appropriate list of names. For example, in the case of locations, we could use a gazetteer, or geographical dictionary, such as the Alexandria Gazetteer or the Getty Gazetteer. However, doing this blindly runs into problems, as shown in below \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.nltk.org/images/locations.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the gazetteer has good coverage of locations in many countries, and incorrectly finds locations like Sanchez in the Dominican Republic and On in Vietnam. Of course we could omit such locations from the gazetteer, but then we won't be able to identify them when they do appear in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gets even harder in the case of names for people or organizations. Any list of such names will probably have poor coverage. New organizations come into existence every day, so if we are trying to deal with contemporary newswire or blog entries, it is unlikely that we will be able to recognize many of the entities using gazetteer lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major source of difficulty is caused by the fact that many named entity terms are ambiguous. Thus May and North are likely to be parts of named entities for DATE and LOCATION, respectively, but could both be part of a PERSON; conversely Christian Dior looks like a PERSON but is more likely to be of type ORGANIZATION. A term like Yankee will be ordinary modifier in some contexts, but will be marked as an entity of type ORGANIZATION in the phrase Yankee infielders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further challenges are posed by multi-word names like Stanford University, and by names that contain other names such as Cecil H. Green Library and Escondido Village Conference Service Center. In named entity recognition, therefore, we need to be able to identify the beginning and end of multi-token sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Named entity recognition is a task that is well-suited to the type of classifier-based approach that we saw for noun phrase chunking. In particular, we can build a tagger that labels each word in a sentence using the IOB format, where chunks are labeled by their appropriate type. Here is part of the CONLL 2002 (conll2002) Dutch training data:\n",

    "# 6   Relation Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Once named entities have been identified in a text, we then want to extract the relations that exist between them. As indicated earlier, we will typically be looking for relations between specified types of named entity. One way of approaching this task is to initially look for all triples of the form (X, α, Y), where X and Y are named entities of the required types, and α is the string of words that intervenes between X and Y. We can then use regular expressions to pull out just those instances of α that express the relation that we are looking for. The following example searches for strings that contain the word in. The special regular expression (?!\\b.+ing\\b) is a negative lookahead assertion that allows us to disregard strings such as success in supervising the transition of, where in is followed by a gerund."
