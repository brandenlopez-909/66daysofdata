    "# 3   Mapping Words to Properties Using Python Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, a tagged word of the form (word, tag) is an association between a word and a part-of-speech tag. Once we start doing part-of-speech tagging, we will be creating programs that assign a tag to a word, the tag which is most likely in a given context. We can think of this process as mapping from words to tags. The most natural way to store mappings in Python uses the so-called dictionary data type (also known as an associative array or hash array in other programming languages). In this section we look at dictionaries and see how they can represent a variety of language information, including parts of speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.1   Indexing Lists vs Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "A text, as we have seen, is treated in Python as a list of words. An important property of lists is that we can \"look up\" a particular item by giving its index, e.g. text1[100]. Notice how we specify a number, and get back a word. We can think of a list as a simple kind of table.\n",
    "\n",

    "# 4.4   Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating the performance of such tools is a central theme in NLP. Recall the processing pipeline in fig-sds; any errors in the output of one module are greatly multiplied in the downstream modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate the performance of a tagger relative to the tags a human expert would assign. Since we don't usually have access to an expert and impartial human judge, we make do instead with **gold standard** test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a corpus which has been manually annotated and which is accepted as a standard against which the guesses of an automatic system are assessed. The tagger is regarded as being correct if the tag it guesses for a given word is the same as the gold standard tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the humans who designed and carried out the original gold standard annotation were only human. Further analysis might show mistakes in the gold standard, or may eventually lead to a revised tagset and more elaborate guidelines. Nevertheless, the gold standard is by definition \"correct\" as far as the evaluation of an automatic tagger is concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5   N-Gram Tagging\n",
    "# 5.1   Unigram Tagging\n",

    "Based on such analysis we may decide to modify the tagset. Perhaps a distinction between tags that is difficult to make can be dropped, since it is not important in the context of some larger processing task.\n",

    "Another way to analyze the performance bound on a tagger comes from the less than 100% agreement between human annotators. [MORE]\n",

    "In general, observe that the tagging process collapses distinctions: e.g. lexical identity is usually lost when all personal pronouns are tagged PRP. At the same time, the tagging process introduces new distinctions and removes ambiguities: e.g. deal tagged as VB or NN. This characteristic of collapsing certain distinctions and introducing new distinctions is an important feature of tagging which facilitates classification and prediction. When we introduce finer distinctions in a tagset, an n-gram tagger gets more detailed information about the left-context when it is deciding what tag to assign to a particular word. However, the tagger simultaneously has to do more work to classify the current token, simply because there are more tags to choose from. Conversely, with fewer distinctions (as with the simplified tagset), the tagger has less information about context, and it has a smaller range of choices in classifying the current token.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that ambiguity in the training data leads to an upper limit in tagger performance. Sometimes more context will resolve the ambiguity. In other cases however, as noted by (Church, Young, & Bloothooft, 1996), the ambiguity can only be resolved with reference to syntax, or to world knowledge. Despite these imperfections, part-of-speech tagging has played a central role in the rise of statistical approaches to natural language processing. In the early 1990s, the surprising accuracy of statistical taggers was a striking demonstration that it was possible to solve one small part of the language understanding problem, namely part-of-speech disambiguation, without reference to deeper sources of linguistic knowledge. Can this idea be pushed further? In Chapter 7., we shall see that it can."

    "# 6   Transformation-Based Tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential issue with n-gram taggers is the size of their n-gram table (or language model). If tagging is to be employed in a variety of language technologies deployed on mobile computing devices, it is important to strike a balance between model size and tagger performance. An n-gram tagger with backoff may store trigram and bigram tables, large sparse arrays which may have hundreds of millions of entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second issue concerns context. The only information an n-gram tagger considers from prior context is tags, even though words themselves might be a useful source of information. It is simply impractical for n-gram models to be conditioned on the identities of words in the context. In this section we examine Brill tagging, an inductive tagging method which performs very well using models that are only a tiny fraction of the size of n-gram taggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brill tagging is a kind of transformation-based learning, named after its inventor. The general idea is very simple: guess the tag of each word, then go back and fix the mistakes. In this way, a Brill tagger successively transforms a bad tagging of a text into a better one. As with n-gram tagging, this is a supervised learning method, since we need annotated training data to figure out whether the tagger's guess is a mistake or not. However, unlike n-gram tagging, it does not count observations but compiles a list of transformational correction rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of Brill tagging is usually explained by analogy with painting. Suppose we were painting a tree, with all its details of boughs, branches, twigs and leaves, against a uniform sky-blue background. Instead of painting the tree first then trying to paint blue in the gaps, it is simpler to paint the whole canvas blue, then \"correct\" the tree section by over-painting the blue background. In the same fashion we might paint the trunk a uniform brown before going back to over-paint further details with even finer brushes. Brill tagging uses the same idea: begin with broad brush strokes then fix up the details, with successively finer changes. Let's look at an example involving the following sentence:\n",

    "(1)\t\tThe President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine the operation of two rules: (a) Replace NN with VB when the previous word is TO; (b) Replace TO with IN when the next tag is NNS. 6.1 illustrates this process, first tagging with the unigram tagger, then applying the rules to fix the errors.\n",

    "In this table we see two rules. All such rules are generated from a template of the following form: \"replace T1 with T2 in the context C\". Typical contexts are the identity or the tag of the preceding or following word, or the appearance of a specific tag within 2-3 words of the current word. During its training phase, the tagger guesses values for T1, T2 and C, to create thousands of candidate rules. Each rule is scored according to its net benefit: the number of incorrect tags that it corrects, less the number of correct tags it incorrectly modifies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brill taggers have another interesting property: the rules are linguistically interpretable. Compare this with the n-gram taggers, which employ a potentially massive table of n-grams. We cannot learn much from direct inspection of such a table, in comparison to the rules learned by the Brill tagger. 6.1 demonstrates NLTK's Brill tagger."

    "# 7   How to Determine the Category of a Word\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have examined word classes in detail, we turn to a more basic question: how do we decide what category a word belongs to in the first place? In general, linguists use morphological, syntactic, and semantic clues to determine the category of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.1   Morphological Clues\n",
    "\n",
    "The internal structure of a word may give useful clues as to the word's category. For example, -ness is a suffix that combines with an adjective to produce a noun, e.g. happy → happiness, ill → illness. So if we encounter a word that ends in -ness, this is very likely to be a noun. Similarly, -ment is a suffix that combines with some verbs to produce a noun, e.g. govern → government and establish → establishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "English verbs can also be morphologically complex. For instance, the **present participle** of a verb ends in -ing, and expresses the idea of ongoing, incomplete action (e.g. falling, eating). The -ing suffix also appears on nouns derived from verbs, e.g. the falling of the leaves (this is known as the gerund).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.2   Syntactic Clues\n",
    "\n",
    "Another source of information is the typical contexts in which a word can occur. For example, assume that we have already determined the category of nouns. Then we might say that a syntactic criterion for an adjective in English is that it can occur immediately before a noun, or immediately following the words be or very. According to these tests, near should be categorized as an adjective:\n",
    "\n",
    "(2)\t\t\n",
    "a.\t\tthe near window\n",
    "\n",
    "b.\t\tThe end is (very) near.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.3   Semantic Clues\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the meaning of a word is a useful clue as to its lexical category. For example, the best-known definition of a noun is semantic: \"the name of a person, place or thing\". Within modern linguistics, semantic criteria for word classes are treated with suspicion, mainly because they are hard to formalize. Nevertheless, semantic criteria underpin many of our intuitions about word classes, and enable us to make a good guess about the categorization of words in languages that we are unfamiliar with. For example, if all we know about the Dutch word verjaardag is that it means the same as the English word birthday, then we can guess that verjaardag is a noun in Dutch. However, some care is needed: although we might translate zij is vandaag jarig as it's her birthday today, the word jarig is in fact an adjective in Dutch, and has no exact equivalent in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.4   New Words\n",
    "\n",
    "All languages acquire new lexical items. A list of words recently added to the Oxford Dictionary of English includes cyberslacker, fatoush, blamestorm, SARS, cantopop, bupkis, noughties, muggle, and robata. Notice that all these new words are nouns, and this is reflected in calling nouns an open class. By contrast, prepositions are regarded as a closed class. That is, there is a limited set of words belonging to the class (e.g., above, along, at, below, beside, between, during, for, from, in, near, on, outside, over, past, through, towards, under, up, with), and membership of the set only changes very gradually over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7.5   Morphology in Part of Speech Tagsets\n",
    "\n",
    "Common tagsets often capture some [pmorpho-syntactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphosyntactic_alignment) information; that is, information about the kind of morphological markings that words receive by virtue of their syntactic role. Consider, for example, the selection of distinct grammatical forms of the word go illustrated in the following sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "(3)\t\t\n",
    "a.\t\tGo away!\n",
    "\n",
    "b.\t\tHe sometimes _goes_ to the cafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.\t\tAll the cakes have _gone_.\n",
    "\n",
    "d.\t\tWe _went_ on the excursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these forms — go, goes, gone, and went — is morphologically distinct from the others. Consider the form, goes. This occurs in a restricted set of grammatical contexts, and requires a third person singular subject. Thus, the following sentences are ungrammatical.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4)\t\t\n",
    "a.\t\t*They sometimes _goes_ to the cafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.\t\t*I sometimes _goes_ to the cafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, gone is the past participle form; it is required after have (and cannot be replaced in this context by goes), and cannot occur as the main verb of a clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5)\t\t\n",
    "a.\t\t*All the cakes have goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.\t\t*He sometimes gone to the cafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily imagine a tagset in which the four distinct grammatical forms just discussed were all tagged as VB. Although this would be adequate for some purposes, a more fine-grained tagset provides useful information about these forms that can help other processors that try to detect patterns in tag sequences. The Brown tagset captures these distinction below\n",

    "In addition to this set of verb tags, the various forms of the verb to be have special tags: be/BE, being/BEG, am/BEM, are/BER, is/BEZ, been/BEN, were/BED and was/BEDZ (plus extra tags for negative forms of the verb). All told, this fine-grained tagging of verbs means that an automatic tagger that uses this tagset is effectively carrying out a limited amount of morphological analysis."
